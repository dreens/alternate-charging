abstract = {Ultimately, the resolution of any spectroscopic experiment is limited by the interaction time between the particles that are to be examined and the measuring device. The obtainable spectroscopic resolution in a molecular beam experiment can be considerably improved using samples of slow molecules, as produced, for example, in a Stark-decelerator. This is demonstrated here by measuring the inversion tunneling spectrum of (ND3)-N-15 using a pulsed molecular beam that has been decelerated to about 52 m/s. Hyperfine resolved inversion transitions in (ND3)-N-15 in the J, K{\textgreater}=1, 1{\textgreater} state (around 1.43 GHz) are induced in a microwave region, and (ND3)-N-15 molecules that have undergone the transition are subsequently detected using a UV-laser based ionization detection scheme. To increase the signal intensity; the decelerated molecular beam is both transversally and longitudinally focused into the laser detection region. The observed spectral width of individual hyperfine transitions in the fully resolved spectrum is about 1 kHz; and the standard deviation of the best fit is 62 Hz.},

abstract = {The motion of polar molecules can be controlled by time-varying inhomogeneous electric fields. In a Stark decelerator, this is exploited to select a fraction of a molecular beam that is accelerated, transported, or decelerated. Phase stability ensures that the selected bunch of molecules is kept together throughout the deceleration process. In this paper an extended description of phase stability in a Stark decelerator is given, including higher-order effects. This analysis predicts a wide variety of resonances that originate from the spatial and temporal periodicity of the electric fields. These resonances are experimentally observed using a beam of OH ((2){\&}UPi;(3/2),v=0,J=3/2) radicals passing through a Stark decelerator.},

Stark-decelerated hydroxyl (OH) radicals were scattered with hexapole-focused nitric oxide (NO) radicals in a crossed-beam configuration. Rotationally and spin-orbit inelastic scattering cross sections were measured on an absolute scale for collision energies between 70 and 300 cm(-1). These cross sections show fair agreement with quantum coupled-channels calculations using a set of coupled model potential energy surfaces based on ab initio calculations for the long-range nonadiabatic interactions and a simplistic short-range interaction.

abstract = {Stark deceleration allows for precise control over the velocity of a pulsed molecular beam and, by the nature of its limited phase-space acceptance, reduces the energy width of the decelerated packet. We describe an alternate method of operating a Stark decelerator that further reduces the energy spread over the standard method of operation. In this alternate mode of operation, we aggressively decelerate the molecular packet using a high phase angle. This technique brings the molecular packet to the desired velocity before it reaches the end of the decelerator; the remaining stages are then used to longitudinally and transversely guide the packet to the detection/interaction region. The result of the initial aggressive slowing is a reduction in the phase-space acceptance of the decelerator and thus a narrowing of the velocity spread of the molecular packet. In addition to the narrower energy spread, this method also results in a velocity spread that is nearly independent of the final velocity. Using the alternate deceleration technique, the energy resolution of molecular collision measurements can be improved considerably.},

abstract = {The transverse motion inside a Stark decelerator plays a large role in the total efficiency of deceleration. We differentiate between two separate regimes of molecule loss during the slowing process. The first mechanism involves distributed loss due to coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion, while the second is a result of the rapid decrease of the molecular velocity within the final few stages. In this work, we describe these effects and present means for overcoming them. Solutions based on modified switching time sequences with the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in the intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low final velocities. We propose a new decelerator design, the quadrupole-guiding decelerator, which eliminates distributed loss due to transverse/longitudinal couplings throughout the slowing process and also exhibits gain over normal deceleration to the lowest velocities.},

Due to the finite physical dimension of the electrode array and practical limitations of the applicable electric fields, only molecules within a specific range of velocities and positions can be efficiently slowed and trapped. These constraints result in a restricted phase space acceptance of the decelerator in directions both transverse and parallel to the molecular beam axis; hence, careful modeling is required for understanding and achieving efficient Stark decelerator operation. We present work on slowing of the hydroxyl radical (OH) elucidating the physics controlling the evolution of the molecular phase space packets both with experimental results and model calculations.

In the traveling wave decelerator, a moving potential is created by a series of ring-shaped electrodes to which oscillating high voltages (HV) are applied. By lowering the frequency of the applied voltages, the molecules confined in the moving trap are decelerated and brought to a standstill. As the molecules are confined in a true 3D well, this kind of deceleration has practically no losses, resulting in a great improvement on the usual Stark deceleration techniques. The necessary voltages are generated by amplifying the output of an arbitrary wave generator using fast HV amplifiers, giving us great control over the trapped molecules. We illustrate this by experiments in which we adiabatically cool trapped NH3 and ND3 molecules and resonantly excite their motion.},

abstract = {Stark deceleration is a technique that uses time-varying inhomogeneous electric fields to decelerate polar molecules for various molecular beam and trapping experiments. New ring-geometry Stark decelerators with continuously varying voltages offer a method to produce a more intense source of molecules in a technique called traveling-wave Stark deceleration. However, this type of deceleration is more experimentally challenging than the more typically used crossed-pin geometry decelerators with pulsed voltages. Here, we present an experimental realization of a ring-geometry Stark decelerator using either continuously varying or discrete voltages. Pulsed-ring Stark deceleration using discrete voltages is easier to implement and, under certain circumstances, is more efficient than traveling-wave Stark deceleration. A comparison of experimental and simulated results between traveling-wave and pulsed-ring Stark deceleration is presented along with a simple model for determining when each mode is more efficient.},

abstract = {Atomic physics was revolutionized by the development of forced evaporative cooling, which led directly to the observation of Bose-Einstein condensation, quantum-degenerate Fermi gases and ultracold optical lattice simulations of condensed-matter phenomena. More recently, substantial progress has been made in the production of cold molecular gases. Their permanent electric dipole moment is expected to generate systems with varied and controllable phases, dynamics and chemistry. However, although advances have been made in both direct cooling and cold-association techniques, evaporative cooling has not been achieved so far. This is due to unfavourable ratios of elastic to inelastic scattering and impractically slow thermalization rates in the available trapped species. Here we report the observation of microwave-forced evaporative cooling of neutral hydroxyl (OH(•)) molecules loaded from a Stark-decelerated beam into an extremely high-gradient magnetic quadrupole trap. We demonstrate cooling by at least one order of magnitude in temperature, and a corresponding increase in phase-space density by three orders of magnitude, limited only by the low-temperature sensitivity of our spectroscopic thermometry technique. With evaporative cooling and a sufficiently large initial population, much colder temperatures are possible; even a quantum-degenerate gas of this dipolar radical (or anything else it can sympathetically cool) may be within reach.},

abstract = {The concept of phase stability in a Stark decelerator ensures that polar molecules can be accelerated, guided, or decelerated without loss; molecules within a certain position and velocity interval are kept together throughout the deceleration process. In this paper the influence of the transverse motion on phase stability in a Stark decelerator is investigated. For typical deceleration experiments—i.e., for high values of the phase angle ϕ0—the transverse motion considerably enhances the region in phase space for which phase stable deceleration occurs. For low values of ϕ0, however, the transverse motion reduces the acceptance of a Stark decelerator and unstable regions in phase space appear. These effects are quantitatively explained in terms of a coupling between the longitudinal and transverse motion. The predicted longitudinal acceptance of a Stark decelerator is verified by measurements on a beam of OH (X 2$\Pi$3∕2,J=3∕2) radicals passing through a Stark decelerator.},

The absolute frequencies of these transitions have been determined with a relative uncertainty of a few parts in {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$}, representing a {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1000-fold improvement over previous measurements. To reach this level of precision, an optical frequency comb has been used to transfer the stability of a narrow-linewidth I{\$}{\_}2{\$}-stabilized reference laser onto the 308-nm spectroscopy laser. The comb is also used to compare the optical frequency of the spectroscopy laser to an atomic clock reference, providing absolute accuracy. Measurements have been carried out on OH/OD molecules in a highly-collimated molecular beam, reducing possible pressure shifts and minimizing Doppler broadening. Systematic shifts due to retroreflection quality, the Zeeman effect, and the ac Stark effect have been considered during the analysis of the measured spectra; particularly in the case of the OD isotopologue, these effects can result in shifts of the fitted line positions of as much as 300 kHz. The transition frequencies extracted in the analysis were also used to determine spectroscopic constants for the {\$}A\backslash, {\^{}}2\backslashSigma{\^{}}+,v'=0{\$} vibronic state. The constants fitted in this work differ significantly from those reported in previous works that measured the {\$}A - X{\$} transitions, resulting in typical deviations of the predicted optical transition frequencies of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}150 MHz, but they generally agree quite well with the constants determined using hyperfine-resolved measurements of splittings within the {\$}A{\$} state.},

abstract = {Although collisions between atoms and molecules are largely understood, collisions between two molecules have proven much harder to study. In both experiment and theory, our ability to determine quantum-state-resolved bimolecular cross-sections lags behind their atom–molecule counterparts by decades. For many bimolecular systems, even rules of thumb—much less intuitive understanding—of scattering cross sections are lacking. Here, we report the measurement of state-to-state differential cross sections on the collision of state-selected and velocity-controlled nitric oxide (NO) radicals and oxygen (O2) molecules. Using velocity map imaging of the scattered NO radicals, the full product-pair correlations of rotational excitation that occurs in both collision partners from individual encounters are revealed. The correlated cross sections show surprisingly good agreement with quantum scattering calculations using ab initio NO−O2 potential energy surfaces. The observations show that the well-known energy-gap law that governs atom–molecule collisions does not generally apply to bimolecular excitation processes, and reveal a propensity rule for the vector correlation of product angular momenta.},

abstract = {With a Stark decelerator, beams of neutral polar molecules can be accelerated, guided at a constant velocity, or decelerated. The effectiveness of this process is determined by the 6D volume in phase space from which molecules are accepted by the Stark decelerator. Couplings between the longitudinal and transverse motion of the molecules in the decelerator can reduce this acceptance. These couplings are nearly absent when the decelerator operates such that only every third electric field stage is used for deceleration, while extra transverse focusing is provided by the intermediate stages. For many applications, the acceptance of a Stark decelerator in this so-called {\$}s=3{\$} mode significantly exceeds that of a decelerator in the conventionally used ({\$}s=1{\$}) mode. This has been experimentally verified by passing a beam of OH radicals through a 2.6 meter long Stark decelerator. The experiments are in quantitative agreement with the results of trajectory calculations, and can qualitatively be explained with a simple model for the 6D acceptance. These results imply that the 6D acceptance of a Stark decelerator in the {\$}s=3{\$} mode of operation approaches the optimum value, i.e. the value that is obtained when any couplings are neglected.},
